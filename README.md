# ID-Documents-Verification-System
ITI Graduation Project - ID and Document Verification System

## Problem Statement
The problem identified in the ITIâ€™s system, while applying to any of the provided training programs, is <b>the significant amount of time</b> consumed during the document review process.<br> 
As shown in this example below:ðŸ‘‡

Currently, applicants wait for a long time until their uploaded documents get reviewed because the revision process is done manually by a person. This manual review process is time-consuming. Consequently, it causes delays in the overall application process, particularly when there are a large number of applicants.

## Proposed Solution
We decided to partially automate this part of the system to save a lot of time. Hence, we used machine learning techniques, such as classification and OCR, to check document validity, extract data from the national ID, etc.

We apply some preprocessing to all the documents and then check every document separately.

  * <b>Personal image check</b>: we check whether it is a formal image that can be accepted or not based on some defined rules, if it is not valid then we reject it.
  * <b>Document Classification</b>: we check whether the applicant uploaded the required document and if yes, then we extract the required data from it like the ID number.
